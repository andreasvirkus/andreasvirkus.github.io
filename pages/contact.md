# tere, tere

That's `hello, hello` in Estonian.

I'm currently helping [Klaus](https://klausapp.com) conquer
the world of customer support's conversation quality.\
But that's not to say I'll turn down an interesting, small(ish?) project
to tinker on, so let me know if you'd like to collab!

Either shoot me an [e-mail](mailto:write@andreasvirkus.me) or find me from the onlines ðŸ‘‡

<script>
import SocialLinks from '@/components/SocialLinks'

export default {
  components: { SocialLinks }
}
