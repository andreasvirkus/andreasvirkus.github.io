# tere, tere

That's `hello, hello` in Estonian.

I'm always looking for interesting, small(ish?) projects
to tinker on, so let me know if you'd like to collab!

Either shoot me an [e-mail](mailto:write@andreasvirkus.me) or find me from the onlines ðŸ‘‡

<social-links/>

<script>
import SocialLinks from '@/components/SocialLinks'

export default {
  components: { SocialLinks }
}
</script>
