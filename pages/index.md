# welcome, welcome

Glad to have you in my small corner of the web.
This site's main purpose is to act as my personal playground for different web
technologies, but also to provide a bit of insight about [me](/about/).

If you're looking to get in touch, just reach out to me on
[linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreasvirkus "View my LinkedIn profile") or via
[e-mail](mailto:write@andreasvirkus.me "Shoot me an e-mail!").

### Roadmap

Freshly refactored from Metalsmith to Vuepress üåà

...And now from Vuepress to Saber ‚öîÔ∏è !

I'll `Soon‚Ñ¢` try and write some posts under the [blog](/thoughts/) section.
They'll mostly be about small development techniques or
explanations of snippets that I often find useful.

Since the site's styles make use of [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) where possible,
I'm hoping to add theming soon as well. Later I'd like you to have the control
over them, saving them with localStorage or IndexedDB for your next visit.
