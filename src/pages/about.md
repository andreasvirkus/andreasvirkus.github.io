# me

I'm not much of a talker, but let me rant about myself for a bit. You can skip ahead to:
my [passions](#superpowers-%E2%9A%A1), overview about my [education](#education) or my [work](#labor).

My full curriculum vitae can be viewed [here](/cv/) and downloaded through the link: [download CV.pdf](/assets/cv/CV-Andreas-Johan-Virkus.pdf).

## superpowers ‚ö°

I'm an aspiring full-stack developer (with a light front-ended tilt). I'm interested in all kinds of visual communication, but my major focus is on designing web applications & interfaces. I love (and preach) all things Node.js, semantic HTML, the power of CSS & progressive enhancement.\
Lately I've really enjoyed tinkering with:
- Vue.js ‚ô•
- Svelte ‚ô•
- PWAs and service-workers
- ~~Webpack~~ various bundlers and bundling optimisations
- ~~Metalsmith~~
- Anything ES6+
- Serverless
- Golang

I work great with designers (challenging _the flow_ and their thought process),
other devs ü§ì or _less-techy folk_ (pretty sure that's the technical term for it).

I've also dabbled in other fields (and hope to perfect them in the future), like:
- automation & shell scripting
- web performance
- CD & CI
- agile thinking
- accessibility
- security
- UNIX-based systems
- dockerisation, Kubernetes
- UX & user flow
- interaction design
- Googling for solutions (near master level üíØ)

## education

Being a self-claimed autodidact, I consider myself a proud drop out. Instead
of going the standard university route (BSc, MSc, internships, etc.), I pivoted and spent
my time tinkering on small private projects, reading books & articles and listening to podcasts.

My biggest educational growth though were the first few months at my first job
and I believe my hunger for knowledge has sky-rocketed ever since. I also love
meetups and conferences (...it's the free swag).

Since some do care about the _official_ part of this, here's a rundown:
- **CS at Tallinn University of Technology**
    - quit June 2015
    - I in no way mean to bad-mouth, but the (at the time) outdated curriculum and narrow-minded teachers left me wanting more. I've listed the relevant completed
    courses under my LinkedIn profile.
- **Hardcore developer training at PluralSight**
    - attended May 2015
    - A thorough overview of a web developer's stack before PluralSight expanded
    their training courses.
- **Certificate in Full Stack Development at Free Code Camp**
    - Spring 2015
- **Exact Science Field at Old Town Educational College** (Secondary education)
    - Graduated June 2012

## labor

I like fiddling small components and scripts on [codepen](https://codepen.io/ajv/pens/popular), [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/user/andreasvirkus/fiddles/), [gist](https://gist.github.com/andreasvirkus/) and on my [Arduino](https://github.com/andreasvirkus).

_* Unfortunately, I can't show most of my recent work on here for [legal reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement).
It's good stuff though._

I started out creating websites for neighbours and small companies, which really sparked a passion. Here's what I've been up to since:
- **Full-stack developer @ [Klaus](https://klausapp.com?utm_source=andreasvirkus.me)**
    - _July 2018_
    - One of the lead front-end engineers in a nifty start-up. I've helped Klaus build an intricate SaaS SPA, that lets customer support agents conduct conversation reviews. I also wrote and manage a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/klaus/kpkjfbkkjolmhnjpcmfmgleobfkakejj?utm_source=andreasvirkus.me), a Zendesk app and couple of other small widgets. I advocate open-source, best practises and security to the best of my abilities and try to integrate them into the developer culture of a growing start-up.
- **Technical consultatnt @ Bigbank**
    - _July 2018 ‚Äì June 2019_
- **FE -> Full-stack developer @ Bigbank**
    - _July 2015 ‚Äì July 2018_
    - I started out supporting an in-house Wordpress theme, helping marketers create pages
    with a page builder. Worked with the design team to unify the corporate visuals
    across multiple countries and platforms (also implemented a pattern library).
    I then shifted bit more towards Node's full-stack world and worked with microservices
    and the Wordpress REST API to render its contents as a separate Vue application.
    I've learned heaps about virtualisation, dockerisation, CI & CD, security,
    authentication, and too much about front-end itself to even list.\
    My last product in the company was a Vue-based component library, coupled with
    an in-house Express middleware and some internal `vue-cli@3` plugins to help developers
    quickly spin up new applications & product instances.
- **Programming teacher @ Saue High school**
    - _Autumn 2015 ‚Äì Spring 2016_
    - My job was to give my students a basic understanding of the principles of
    programming, whilst keeping it a fun learning experience. I teach Python
    mostly through games and active user input, so their first experience
    with programming wouldn't be stale.
- **Freelancing @ interwebs**
    - _Started 2014_
    - Programming has long been an interest of mine. Having also a soft spot
    for the artsy side in me‚Äîfront-end development seemed like an excellent
    field to start gaining some experience.

In my free time I enjoy working on my motorcycle, disc golfing, practising muay thai & BJJ... and starring [GitHub repos](https://github.com/andreasvirkus?tab=stars) ‚≠ê.
