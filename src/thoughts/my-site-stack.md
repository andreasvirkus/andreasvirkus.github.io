I feel like this is the _must-have_ first post for every/any developer
who's managed to set up a blog with a static-site generator, only I'm
5 years late to the party and I forgot to feed my rabbit. ðŸ¥•

Rundown of what you'll get once I manage to finish this draft:

- What's the _haps_ with static site generators (SSGs)
- Metalsmith (and why I prefer it)
- The awesome-sauce that is Netlify
- Building a JAM stack (this site really isn't one, but we'll talk a bit about what a JAM stack is)
- Stuff other similar posts don't usually mention
  - service workers and are they worth on a static site?
  - generating a sitemap, RSS feed and other tidbits
  - Adding a CMS ([Netlify-CMS](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms))
  - etc.

Other interesting findings/credits(?).
