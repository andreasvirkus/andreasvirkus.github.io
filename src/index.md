# welcome, welcome.

I see you've managed to find my secret lair... I bet the impeccable SEO helped.

It's alright to have a look around, but don't touch anything!<br>
I kid, I kid... I've set up a _blogish_ thing so you wouldn't get bored
and a dashboard about the site's visitor statistics and performance metrics.

Since the site's styles make use of [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) where possible,
I'm hoping to add theming soon as well, leveraging localStorage or IndexedDB.

You can have a look at this site's roadmap in the repo's [readme file](https://github.com/andreasvirkus/andreasvirkus.github.io).

If you're looking to get in touch, just reach out to me on linkedIn or via e-mail.
