# me

I'm an aspiring <span class="text__line-through">full-stack</span> front-end developer. I'm interested in all kinds of visual communication, but my major focus is on designing web interfaces. I love (and preach) all things Node, semantic HTML, the power of CSS & progressive enhancement. Lately I've really enjoyed tinkering with:
- Vue.js â™¥
- Webpack
- Metalsmith
- Anything ES6

I've also dabbled in other fields (and hope to perfect them in the future), like:
- scripting
- web performance
- CD & CI
- agile thinking
- accessibility
- UNIX-based systems
- dockerisation/Kubernetes

I work great with designers (challenging _the flow_ and their thought process),
other devs ðŸ¤“ or _less-techy folk_ (pretty sure that's the technical term for it).

My full curriculum vitae is downloadable through the link:

<!-- TODO: List skills, hobbies (?) etc -->

In my free time I enjoy working on my motorcycle, disc golf and practising muay thai & BJJ.
