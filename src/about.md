# me

## superpowers ‚ö°

I'm an aspiring <span class="text__line-through">full-stack</span> front-end developer. I'm interested in all kinds of visual communication, but my major focus is on designing web interfaces. I love (and preach) all things Node, semantic HTML, the power of CSS & progressive enhancement. Lately I've really enjoyed tinkering with:
- Vue.js ‚ô•
- Webpack
- Metalsmith
- Anything ES6

I work great with designers (challenging _the flow_ and their thought process),
other devs ü§ì or _less-techy folk_ (pretty sure that's the technical term for it).

I've also dabbled in other fields (and hope to perfect them in the future), like:
- automation & shell scripting
- web performance
- CD & CI
- agile thinking
- accessibility
- UNIX-based systems
- dockerisation/Kubernetes
- UX & user flow
- interaction design
- Googling for solutions (near master level üíØ)

My full curriculum vitae is downloadable through the link: [Download CV.pdf](/assets/cv/CV-Andreas-johan-virkus.pdf).

## education

Being a self-claimed autodidact, I consider myself a proud drop out. Instead
of going the standard university route (BSc, MSc, internships, etc.), I pivoted and spent
my time tinkering on small private projects, reading books & articles and listening to podcasts.

My biggest educational growth though were the first few months at my first job
and I believe my hunger for knowledge has sky-rocketed ever since.

I love meetups and conferences (though not the ones all 'bout fluff).

Since some do care about the _official_ part of this, here's a rundown:
- **CS at Tallinn University of Technology**
    - quit June 2015
    - description
- **Hardcore developer training at PluralSight**
    - May 2015
    - description
- **Certificate in Full Stack Development at Free Code Camp**
    - Spring 2015
    - description
- **Exact Science Field at Old Town Educational College** (Secondary education)
    - Graduated June 2012

## labor

I like fiddling small components and scripts on codepen, jsfiddle and on my Arduino.
I started out creating websites for neighbours and small companies:
- **FE developer at Bigbank**
    - _July 2015‚Äìcurrent_
    - TODO: Enter job description
- **Programming teacher at Saue High school**
    - _Autumn 2015‚ÄìSpring 2016_
    - My job was to give my students a basic understanding of the principles of
    programming, whilst keeping it a fun learning experience. I teach Python
    mostly through games and active user input, so their first experience
    with programming wouldn't be stale.
- **Freelancing**
    - _Started 2014_
    - Programming has long been an interest of mine. Having also a soft spot
    for the artsy side in me‚Äîfront-end development seemed like an excellent
    field to start gaining some experience.

In my free time I enjoy working on my motorcycle, disc golf and practising muay thai & BJJ... and starring Github repos ‚≠ê.
