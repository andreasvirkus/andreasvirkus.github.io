# me

I'm an aspiring <span class="text__line-through">full-stack</span> front-end developer. I'm interested in all kinds of visual communication, but my major focus is on designing web interfaces. I love (and preach) all things Node, semantic HTML, the power of CSS & progressive enhancement. I've also dabbled in other fields (and hope to perfect them in the future), like:
- scripting
- web performance
- CD & CI
- agile thinking
- accessibility
- UNIX-based systems
- dockerisation/Kubernetes
