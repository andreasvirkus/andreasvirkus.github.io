# geeky statistics

Here you can have a look at some of this site's metrics. It'll (hopefully)
present user statistics (no. of visits, devices used, duration of session) and performance metrics (avg. load time, site weight, build time?).

Might feature other thingamajingies as well, but most likely won't. Since I'm a lazy bum.
