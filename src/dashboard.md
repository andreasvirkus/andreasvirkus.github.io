# geeky statistics

Here you can have a look at some of this site's metrics. It'll (hopefully)
present user statistics (no. of visits, devices used, duration of session) and performance metrics (avg. load time, site weight, etc.).

Might one day feature Metalsmith-related statistics like average
build times for this site and so on.

Sections:
- [visitor data](#visitor-data)
- [performance data](#performance-data) (WIP)
