### A humble landing page of sorts...

Code for my current portfolio-ish site.

----------
### TODO:

- Content
- Dynamic navigation
    - History API support
    - Page transitions (menu overlay into the next page's solid white background)
- Sitemap & robots.txt
- Analytics & dashboard (visitor statistics & performance metrics)
- Theming? Since the site is built on CSS custom properties, wouldn't be a lot to change
    - LocalStorage/IndexedDB for saving themes
- Offline support, manifest.json etc
- Maybe write some blog posts you lazy bum
