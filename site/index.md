# welcome, welcome

Glad to have you in my small corner of the web.
This site's main purpose is to act as my personal playground for different web
technologies, but also to provide a bit of insight about [me](/about).

### Poke me

If you're looking to get in touch, just reach out to me on
[linkedIn](https://ee.linkedin.com/pub/andreas-johan-virkus/a4/928/22 "View my LinkedIn profile") or via
[e-mail](mailto:write@andreasvirkus.me "Shoot me a mail!").

### Roadmap

⚠️ Currently refactoring from Metalsmith to Vuepress ⚠️

I'll soon try and write some posts under the [blog](/thoughts) section. They'll
mostly be about small development techniques or explanations of snippets
that I often find useful.

Since the site's styles make use of [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) where possible,
I'm hoping to add theming soon as well. Later I'd like you to have the control
over them, saving them with localStorage or IndexedDB for your next visit.

You can have a look at this site's roadmap in the repo's [readme file](https://github.com/andreasvirkus/andreasvirkus.github.io#roadmap).
