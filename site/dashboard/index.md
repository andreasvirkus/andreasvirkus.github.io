## ðŸ”§ Under (re)construction

I'll have the performance dashboards back up in a jiffy!

Here you can have a look at some of this site's metrics. It'll (hopefully)
present user statistics (no. of visits, devices used, duration of session)
and performance metrics (avg. load time, site weight, etc.).

_**Note:** The load time (TTFB estimation) displays the correct time only if you reload this sub-page (since it makes use of [`performance.timing.navigationStart`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceTiming/navigationStart))._

Sections:
- [visitor data](#visitor-data)
- [performance data](#performance-data) (WIP)
