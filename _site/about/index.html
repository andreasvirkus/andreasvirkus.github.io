<p>I'm an aspiring full-stack developer (with a light front-ended tilt). I'm interested in all kinds of visual communication, but my major focus is on designing web applications &amp; interfaces. I love (and preach) all things Node.js, semantic HTML, the power of CSS &amp; progressive enhancement.<br>
Lately I've really enjoyed tinkering with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vue.js ‚ô•</li>
<li>Svelte ‚ô•</li>
<li>PWAs and service-workers</li>
<li><s>Webpack</s> various bundlers and bundling optimisations</li>
<li><s>Metalsmith</s></li>
<li>Anything ES6+</li>
<li>Serverless</li>
<li>Golang</li>
</ul>
<p>I work great with designers (challenging <em>the flow</em> and their thought process),<br>
other devs ü§ì or <em>less-techy folk</em> (pretty sure that's the technical term for it).</p>
<p>I've also dabbled in other fields (and hope to perfect them in the future), like:</p>
<ul>
<li>automation &amp; shell scripting</li>
<li>web performance</li>
<li>CD &amp; CI</li>
<li>agile thinking</li>
<li>accessibility</li>
<li>security</li>
<li>UNIX-based systems</li>
<li>dockerisation, Kubernetes</li>
<li>UX &amp; user flow</li>
<li>interaction design</li>
<li>Googling for solutions (near master level üíØ)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="education">education <a class="direct-link" href="#education" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>Being a self-claimed autodidact, I consider myself a proud drop out. Instead<br>
of going the standard university route (BSc, MSc, internships, etc.), I pivoted and spent<br>
my time tinkering on small private projects, reading books &amp; articles and listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>My biggest educational growth though were the first few months at my first job<br>
and I believe my hunger for knowledge has sky-rocketed ever since. I also love<br>
meetups and conferences (...it's the free swag).</p>
<p>Since some do care about the <em>official</em> part of this, here's a rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CS at Tallinn University of Technology</strong>
<ul>
<li>quit June 2015</li>
<li>I in no way mean to bad-mouth, but the (at the time) outdated curriculum and narrow-minded teachers left me wanting more. I've listed the relevant completed<br>
courses under my LinkedIn profile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hardcore developer training at PluralSight</strong>
<ul>
<li>attended May 2015</li>
<li>A thorough overview of a web developer's stack before PluralSight expanded<br>
their training courses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Certificate in Full Stack Development at Free Code Camp</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spring 2015</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Exact Science Field at Old Town Educational College</strong> (Secondary education)
<ul>
<li>Graduated June 2012</li>

<p>I started out creating websites for neighbours and small companies, which really sparked a passion. Here's what I've been up to since:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Full-stack developer @ <a href="https://klausapp.com?utm_source=andreasvirkus.me">Klaus</a></strong>
<ul>
<li><em>July 2018</em></li>
<li>One of the lead front-end engineers in a nifty start-up. I've helped Klaus build an intricate SaaS SPA, that lets customer support agents conduct conversation reviews. I also wrote and manage a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/klaus/kpkjfbkkjolmhnjpcmfmgleobfkakejj?utm_source=andreasvirkus.me">chrome extension</a>, a Zendesk app and couple of other small widgets. I advocate open-source, best practises and security to the best of my abilities and try to integrate them into the developer culture of a growing start-up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Technical consultatnt @ Bigbank</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>July 2018 ‚Äì June 2019</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>FE -&gt; Full-stack developer @ Bigbank</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>July 2015 ‚Äì July 2018</em></li>
<li>I started out supporting an in-house Wordpress theme, helping marketers create pages<br>
with a page builder. Worked with the design team to unify the corporate visuals<br>
across multiple countries and platforms (also implemented a pattern library).<br>
I then shifted bit more towards Node's full-stack world and worked with microservices<br>
and the Wordpress REST API to render its contents as a separate Vue application.<br>
I've learned heaps about virtualisation, dockerisation, CI &amp; CD, security,<br>
authentication, and too much about front-end itself to even list.<br>
My last product in the company was a Vue-based component library, coupled with<br>
an in-house Express middleware and some internal <code>vue-cli@3</code> plugins to help developers<br>
quickly spin up new applications &amp; product instances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Programming teacher @ Saue High school</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Autumn 2015 ‚Äì Spring 2016</em></li>
<li>My job was to give my students a basic understanding of the principles of<br>
programming, whilst keeping it a fun learning experience. I teach Python<br>
mostly through games and active user input, so their first experience<br>
with programming wouldn't be stale.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Freelancing @ interwebs</strong>
<ul>
<li><em>Started 2014</em></li>
<li>Programming has long been an interest of mine. Having also a soft spot<br>
for the artsy side in me‚Äîfront-end development seemed like an excellent<br>
field to start gaining some experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In my free time I enjoy working on my motorcycle, disc golfing, practising muay thai &amp; BJJ... and starring <a href="https://github.com/andreasvirkus?tab=stars">GitHub repos</a> ‚≠ê.</p>
