<p>Glad to have you in my small corner of the web.<br>
This site's main purpose is to act as my personal playground for different web<br>
technologies, but also to provide a bit of insight about <a href="/about/">me</a>.</p>

<h3 id="roadmap">Roadmap <a class="direct-link" href="#roadmap" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>Freshly refactored from Metalsmith to Vuepress ðŸŒˆ</p>
<p>I'll Soonâ„¢ try and write some posts under the <a href="/thoughts/">blog</a> section. They'll<br>
mostly be about small development techniques or explanations of snippets<br>
that I often find useful.</p>
<p>Since the site's styles make use of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*">CSS Custom Properties</a> where possible,<br>
I'm hoping to add theming soon as well. Later I'd like you to have the control<br>
over them, saving them with localStorage or IndexedDB for your next visit.</p>
<p>You can have a look at this site's roadmap in the repo's <a href="https://github.com/andreasvirkus/andreasvirkus.github.io#roadmap">readme file</a>.</p>
